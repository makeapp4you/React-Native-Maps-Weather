Compatibility

Due to the rapid changes being made in the React Native ecosystem, we are not officially going to support this module on anything but the latest version of React Native. With that said, we will do our best to stay compatible with older versions as much that is practical, and the peer dependency of this requirement is set to "react-native": "*" explicitly for this reason. If you are using an older version of React Native with this module though, some features may be buggy.

Note about React requires

Since react-native 0.25.0, React should be required from node_modules. React Native versions from 0.18 should be working out of the box, for lower versions you should add react as a dependency in your package.json.
